# 🚨 Solana Signal Alert Bot

This module contains the core logic for detecting on-chain activity signals and triggering alert events for high-interest Solana tokens. It forms the second half of the modular alpha signal pipeline, working in tandem with the [collector bot](../collector_bot/README.md) to monitor and respond to emerging DeFi opportunities.

---

## 🔧 Overview

The alert bot:

- Polls token metadata via Solana APIs
- Applies logical checks to determine potential significance
- Sends structured alerts to Discord (in private version)
- Operates continuously as a monitoring layer

This module is designed to be adaptable, efficient, and extendable for use in broader research or automated strategy frameworks.

## 🔐 About This Version

> The file `signal_bot_public.py` offers a **safe, simplified version** of the alerting process. It demonstrates general inspection logic while **omitting the proprietary filtering methods and alerting infrastructure** used in the live system.

**Private components removed include:**
- Feature scoring logic and signal thresholds
- Smart money detection, clustering, or token age filters
- Discord notification implementation
- Token prioritisation based on performance characteristics

These features are withheld to protect intellectual property and maintain competitive integrity in ongoing live deployments.

## 🧠 Research Context

This module will support academic exploration into predictive modelling for early-stage token dynamics on decentralised networks. It provides a real-time pipeline for gathering candidate token behaviours, later modelled in the statistical and machine learning phase of the research.
